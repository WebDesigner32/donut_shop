In this Project, we are asked to form a constructor function for Top Pot Donuts, given location specific attributes.

Primarily, we are asked to form methods that calculate donut totals for the day and for the hour. We are also required to render these totals to the DOM using a table, which is provided in a separate file I titled index1.html.

Additionally, we must give our application the cabability to add a new location with related numeric data to the table as a new row. I added a button that will clear the added location with corresponding numeric data, as an extra feature.

Finally, I am required to give attribution to the people and organizations that inspired me. They are as follows:

1. Google Fonts
2. Adobe Color CC
3. TA's (Artistic Suggestions)
